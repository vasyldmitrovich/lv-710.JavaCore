/** Create an interface to the method calculatePay(), the base class Employee with a string variable employeeId.
        * Create two classes SalariedEmployee and ContractEmployee, which implement interface and are inherited from the base class.
        * Describe hourly paid workers in the relevant classes (one of the children),
        * and fixed paid workers (second child).
        * Describe the string variable socialSecurityNumber in the class SalariedEmployee .
        * Include a description of federalTaxIdMember in the class of contractEmployee .
        * The calculation formula for the "time-worker“ is:
        "the average monthly salary = hourly rate * number of hours worked"
        * For employees with a fixed payment the formula is:
        "the average monthly salary = fixed monthly payment“
        * Create an array of employees and add the employees with different form of payment.
        * Arrange the entire sequence of workers descending the average monthly wage.
        * Output the employee ID, name, and the average monthly wage for all elements of the list.
