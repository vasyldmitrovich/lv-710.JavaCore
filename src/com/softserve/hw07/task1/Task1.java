/**

 * Create two classes SalariedEmployee and ContractEmployee, which implement
 * interface and are inherited from the base class.
 *  - Describe hourly paid workers in the relevant classes (one of the children), and fixed paid workers (second child).
 *  - Describe the string variable socialSecurityNumber in the class SalariedEmployee .
 *  - Include a description of federalTaxIdMember in the class of ContractEmployee.

 *  the average monthly salary = hourly rate * number of hours worked
 *  - For employees with a fixed payment the formula is: the average monthly salary = fixed monthly payment
 *  - Create an array of employees and add the employees with different form of payment.
 *  - Arrange the entire sequence of workers descending the average monthly wage. Output the
 *  employee ID, name, and the average monthly wage for all elements of the list.
